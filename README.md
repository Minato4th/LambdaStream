Ok, guys, let's play with Stream API little bit.

1) Count how many occurrences of each word are in the string
2) Write a method that will filter collection of users that are > 40 years
3) Write a method that will detect Student Valera with highest score from each Major! (Create class Student and Major for these purposes)
4) Write a method to extract the youngest user
5) Sort collection of strings and remove duplicates
